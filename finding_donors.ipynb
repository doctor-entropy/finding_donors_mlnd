    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Support Vector Machines (SVM):\n",
    "\n",
    " **Real World Application:** Support Vector Machines are widely used in many biomedical applications for predicting and classifying diseases such as diabetes and cancer from features like symptoms and computer images. They are also used in classifying genes into their respective labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths of SVM:** This algorithm is highly advantageous when the number of dimensions or features are large.The algorithm also works well when there are distinct margins between datasets of different labels.Kernel trick can be implemented on the SVM algorithm which converts a low dimensional non-seperable dataset and into a high dimensional separable dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Weakness of the SVM:** The algorithm is not computationally efficient and requires long computational times and power. It also does not perform well when the margins are tight and if there is noise in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is SVM a good model for this problem:** The number of features in this dataset is high and thus SVM's may provide a good classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Decision Trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Word Applications:** Decision Trees are widely used in Large Hadron Collider to detect sub atomic particles. They are also used in Astronomy to filter noises in Hubble Space Telescope Images and for detecting Quasars in certain potential clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**strengths of DTs:** Decision Trees can perform effective feature selection and thus highlights features that best work on the given data. Decision trees are easy to work with even on non-linear data. Predictions are very fast. They are also easy to visualize and present to our peers/boss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weakness of DTs:** Decision trees produce only orthogonal boundaries and does not generalize well to 'rotated' or 'slanted' data. Decision trees are highly sensitive to small variations in the training data. When one of extreme data points are removed, the decision tree produced will be quiet different.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is DTs good for this problem:** Since there are many features in this problem, Decision trees can perform feature selection and work only on important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Word Applications:** KNNs are used to classify images that are closely related to other data points. Facebook may use KNN to recommend tagging of friends photos based on the images of that person it has already seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths of KNN:** This algorithm is effective when training data is very large. KNN's are easy to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weakness of KNN:** Querying and predicting can take longer if there are many testing datas'. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is KNN good for this problem:** Since there are only two labels, we can correctly classify most data points closest to the training points.\n",

    "For this analysis, we have used three different algorithms, Support Vector Classifiers (SVC), Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbours. From the above graph, we can see that the largest F-score, when 100% of data is used, corresponds to **Support Vector Machines** followed by Decision Tree classifier and KNN classifier. When more data is available, Decision tree classifier may be the better option. As we can see, The F-score gradually increases when the data available increases. The score of Decision Tree is about the same as SVC and KNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to note that as the dataset increases, the time required for computation on the training data exponentially increases for SVC. Thus, if we have large datasets, SVC may not be a good algorithm to train on. Also, the time required for predicting on the testing set exponentially increases for KNN. This is because the querying time is computationally time consuming for this algorithm. \n",

    "Thus, from looking at the benefits and costs of all the algorithms, I would recommend CharityML to proceed with Decision Trees as the F-score is relatively good (may become better with more data) and requires very less training and testing time on data. Decision trees also provide feature selections and thus may provide deeper insights into our data. "

    "## Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that has a `feature_importance_` attribute, which is a function that ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier.  In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset."

    "### Question 6 - Feature Relevance Observation\n",
    "When **Exploring the Data**, it was shown there are thirteen available features for each individual on record in the census data. Of these thirteen records, which five features do you believe to be most important for prediction, and in what order would you rank them and why?"

    "I would rank the top 5 features in the following order of descending imporatance:\n",
    "- Education number\n",
    "- Age\n",
    "- Hours per week\n",
    "- Capital Gain\n",
    "- Occupation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A person with a bachelor's degree or higher is most likely to be in a better position than a person with only a high school diploma or lesser. A person's age is also important because experience is more important for a higher pay. It is also important to account for the number of hours of work per week performed by the person at his job. It is directly proportional to their income. The capital gain is also the measure of one's income. The type of occupation is little less important but essential to look at."

Higher the educational number, more likely will that person have a full time job and greater will be his capital gains. \n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
